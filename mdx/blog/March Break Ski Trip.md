Despite COVID, we were able to go on a ski trip! Obviously we were very meticulous with hygiene, no wanted to get COVID... (situational irony incoming)

We had a lot of fun! We had so many people going as well, the picture below is a group photo! I think we had around 14 total people that went.

The resort we went to was **Mt.St Louis & Moonstone**. I've been to this resort so many times, because I used to have a season pass back in grade 8.

Still, having friends there made it worth it. Tried a few new tricks at the terrain park, still to scared to do the rails tho!

We had poutine for dinner and tis was a very tiring trip. 

After the trip, unfortunately, some us got COVID. Luckily, everyone got better soon. 

I hope to go to ski trips more often and take more photos of them in the future, hopefully I get to go on higher peaks. See you guys in the next post!
